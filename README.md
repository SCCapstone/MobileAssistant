# MobileAssistant

Our app will have an assistant that will be similar to Google Assistant. The user
will be able to interact with an animated character by talking to him/her with commands 
or conversations. The app will respond with an appropriate answer.

Your audience for the Readme.md are other developers who are joining your team.
Specifically, the file should contain detailed instructions that any developer
can follow to install, compile, run, and test your project. These are not only
useful to new developers, but also to you when you have to re-install everything
because your old laptop crashed. Also, the teachers of this class will be
following your instructions.
